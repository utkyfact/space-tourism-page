## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### Screenshot

![](./image.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- HTML partial structure (very funny experience)
- JavaScript (Vanillia)
### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

I was able to dynamically display data from data.json using the fetch method with partials structure in HTML

### Continued development

In my future projects, I definitely won't use such a structure. This was something I did just to see what would happen. In the future, I will use much more efficient and simpler structures.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me for set up some complicated structures reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://chatgpt.com/) - This helped me a lot in editing my codes.
