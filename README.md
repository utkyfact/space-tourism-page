## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- HTML partial structure (very funny experience)
- JavaScript (Vanillia)
### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

I was able to dynamically display data from data.json using the fetch method with partials structure in HTML

### Continued development

In my future projects, I definitely won't use such a structure. This was something I did just to see what would happen. In the future, I will use much more efficient and simpler structures.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me for set up some complicated structures reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://chatgpt.com/) - This helped me a lot in editing my codes.
